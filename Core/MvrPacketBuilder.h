// ----------------
// MUTATION METHODS
// ----------------

// These methods can only be called while the builder is not producing the packet (so, before willStart: and after didEndWithError:). They'll thrown an exception if called during building.

// Sets a value for the given key in the metadata header of this packet. Works exactly like -setObject:forKey: in NSDictionary.
// Keys are sorted lexicographically before being written into the header, so that packets with the same metadata keys and values and the same payloads will produce byte-for-byte equal packets.
// Note that metadata values and keys cannot contain the NULL ('\0') character. An exception will be thrown if either does.
- (void) setMetadataValue:(NSString*) v forKey:(NSString*) k;

// Removes the given key and its associated value from the metadata header of this packet.
- (void) removeMetadataValueForKey:(NSString*) key;

// Sets a payload for a specific key. Payloads are ordered in the order they're added.
// Adding a payload for a key that's already there will remove the current payload from its position and add the new payload to the end with the same key.
// body can be:
// - a NSData object. If so, length is ignored (pass kMvrPacketBuilderDefaultLength).
// - an UNOPENED NSInputStream. It will be scheduled on this thread's run loop on the common modes. If you pass a NSInputStream, you must also specify the stream's length. No more than length bytes will be read from it before closing.
// If the stream ends before length bytes, packetBuilder:didEndWithError: will be called with an appropriate error (kMvrPacketParserErrorDomain/kMvrPacketBuilderNotEnoughDataInStreamError)
- (void) addPayload:(id) payload length:(unsigned long long) length forKey:(NSString*) key;

// YES if we're between willStart: and didEnd: as seen by the delegate.
@property(readonly, getter=isRunning) BOOL running;

// call this from willStart or didProduceData to end.
// will call didEndWithError: with a NSCocoaErrorDomain/NSUserCancelledError.
- (void) stop;

// While a packet builder is paused, calls that aren't ready to be delivered "without waiting" are put on hold until the builder is unpaused.
// This is a HINT. A paused packet builder can still send didProduceData: messages to its delegate while paused if those messages are ready to be processed; it can even finish providing the entire message without pausing (thus causing didEndWithError: to be called). This may at times cause this property to be ignored even if correctly set.
// Still, this property will be respected in any case where the builder would need to allocate more memory and/or access outside, slower-than-RAM resources such as reading from disk; if a paused builder is faced with either prospect, it will instead opt to wait until unpaused.
// This property is reset to NO whenever the builder starts producing a packet.
@property(getter=isPaused) BOOL paused;

// Reports the progress of a building operation.
// The value is only meaningful between a willStart and a didEndWithError.
// The value may also be unavailable, in which case it will be kMvrIndeterminateProgress.
