/*
 
 The packet parser works like some sort of state machine-driven thingie. When just created, it's in a 'starting state' with an empty buffer. As you append data, it progresses through a set of states, sending events to the delegate as it finds interesting stuff.
 
 It's possible that what got passed was truncated with partially-valid data, not enough to emit an event. In that case, the leftover data will be stored by the parser in a buffer until subsequent appendData:... calls complete the data or produce an invalid packet. If a packet is completed successfully, parsing will restart with the remaining data in the buffer, unless packetParserShouldResetAfterCompletingPacket: returns YES.
